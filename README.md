Hi there ðŸ‘‹. I'm Bruno, a junior Software Engineer with an entrepreneurial mindset. After being admitted to the "[PrytanÃ©e Militaire](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prytan%C3%A9e_militaire_de_Saint-Louis)" competition at 10, I spend 6 years in Mali for my secondary studies then 5 years in Morocco for my graduate studies in computer sciences.

In 2017, I co-founded and held the role of [CTO at Bassite](https://www.therollingnotes.com/2018/03/06/bodian-bacary-bruno-cto-bassite/), a startup that specialized in the development of conversational agents. Today, I am an IT consultant within Air Liquide Paris for the development of a healthcare mobile application.

I am passionate about new technologies and the applications that can be made of them. In my spare time, I work on personal projects which one day I hope will have a positive impact on the world.
